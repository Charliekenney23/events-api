If we all wear our favorite Elizabeth \ud83d\udc55and buttons, I'm positive we can engage hundreds of future Warren supporters! They can Text FIGHT to 24477 to get hooked up with the campaign.\n\nTim McGraw is playing a free concert Friday night and Dierks Bentley is playing on Saturday night. Other artists are playing through the event as well.\n\nI'll be available both days by text to answer questions and provide support. We may try to arrange a get-together, perhaps for lunch on both days.",
