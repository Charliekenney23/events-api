Senator Warren's campaign is not accepting any money at all from PACs or lobbyists, so support from regular folks like you helps a great deal. Please consider a donation to the Warren for President campaign, and even better, set it to automatically renew each month!\n\nPlease donate here: elizabethwarren.com/partydonate",
