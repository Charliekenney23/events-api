Our team knows that to create real change - to rebuild the middle class and save our democracy - we need to dream big, fight hard, and connect with voters in every community.  That's why we're in this fight: to have real conversations about how to level the playing field for working families, and who is best to lead that fight.  \nIf you have any accessibility needs, please let Lorenza Ramirez know by emailing lramirez@elizabethwarren.com or calling/texting 410-375-3571 so we can make sure the event will be accessible and comfortable for you.",
